# Fun Facts

The MERN stack project consists of four subprojects, each serving different functionalities to create an interactive web application. The main goal of the project is to provide users with fun facts to read, allow them to upload and store personal URLs, and give the owner the ability to manage fun facts and uploaded URLs through a locally hosted React application.

This app consists of four parts. This is the part 1 of the Fun Facts Web App.

## Part 2: Backend and Database (Fun Facts)

The second subproject consists of a backend built using Node.js and Express, along with a MongoDB database. This backend handles the storage and retrieval of fun facts uploaded by the owner through the local React app (Part 1). When the owner adds new fun facts, they get stored in the database, making them accessible to users via the frontend.
